I have just created a branch, which I named 'branch1' and inside the branch, I created a new file called 'README.md1' To do that, I ran the command 'git checkout -b new branch' with '-b' the command of creating a new branch and 'new branch' the name of the branch. Once I created the branch, I went inside the branch and created a file that I called 'README.md1' To do this, I used the command of creating a file which is 'touch README.md1. Then inside the file, I started editing and adding this information directly from the terminal. To edit this file directly from the terminal, I used the command 'nano README.md!' to edit it and add more information. Other options I had were the 'vim README.md1' command and 'cat README.md1' command which is used to just view the file without editing it. Another option which seems the easiest was using the echo editor. The command of usinf the echo editor is 'echo "The content to add" > README.md1'. After adding this content, I used 'CTRL + O' command to write out the changes and then 'CTRL + X' to exit nano mode.
