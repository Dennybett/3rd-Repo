# 3rd-Repo
The third one
Making changes on my local VS code before staging them with the git add command

First step was to create this Repository on github
Second step was to clone it using SSH key
Third was to run the git init command to initialize it. I did this in the terminal using the git init command. 
To run the git init command, I had to be in the correct directory where the repository is stored

I have made this few edifications on VS code which I intend to stage them using git add.
Before staging them, I had to first save them in the VS code
After saving them, I used the terminal to view and stage them.

I was having a hard time finding this README on the terminal, but it was hidden inside the 'main' branch which was inside the 'master' branch

After finishing the edits and saving them in VS Code, I staged them using the 'git add README.md' comand to add them to the terminal, then I used the 'git status' to view before using the 'git commit -m' command with a "brief description of what I had done.

The final step was to push to the remote repository. For this I used the "git push origin main" command
